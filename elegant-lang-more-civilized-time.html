# Agenda

1. What is Clojure?
2. Syntax and Functions
3. ...

---

# Clojure is...
--

- A functional Lisp
```clojure
user=> (println "Hello iHeart!")
Hello iHeart!
nil
```
--

- Immutable by default
```clojure
(def character {:name "Obi Wan"})
user=> (assoc character :name "Brian")
{:name "Brian"}
user=> character
{:name "Obi Wan"}
```
--

- Has some incredible tooling ([Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel), [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), [spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec))
--

- It compiles to both JVM and Javascript targets.
--

  - Yes this is actually a mature and stable feature.
--


- Initially developed by Rich Hickey at Cognitect.

???
- Functional first, has basically no idiomatic OO facilities
- Very focused on using raw data and simple data structures like lists, vectors, and maps
- Immutability by default allows for really straightforward ergonomics for asynchronous code
- Figwheel gives hot code reloading in JS, and preserves the program state, allowing you to quickly and intuitively tinker with UI elements that would otherwise take a full page refresh and a bunch of clicks and typing to reestablish the desired state.

---

Common Data Types

```clojure
true false

"Strings!"                     ;; Comments start with semicolons

42                

:keywords

#{"Heterogenous" :sets}

{:associative "Maps"}

["Heterogenous" :lists]

(defn funcs [param] (inc param))

(defmacro infix [x operator y] ;; Macros write code at compile time
   (list operator x y))
```

```python
    print("Hello world")
```
---

#Don't Fear the (Paren)s

???
- A lot of devs have a view of Lisps as piles of parens
- It's not that different from say, python
- Here's an example with the same number of parens for a function
- They're just in different places, and you get to skip some other syntax.

--

Python

```python
def my_csv(things):
    return ", ".join(things)
```

--

Clojure

```clojure
(require '[clojure.string :as s])

(defn my-csv [things]
    (s/join ", " things))
```
---

Function Declaration and Use

```clojure
(defn my-add   ;; Function name
  [x y]               ;; Parameters
  "A simple function" ;; Docstring
  (+ x y))            ;; Function body
(my-add 3 3)
;; 6
```

???
- Function declaration is really straightforward in Clojure.
- Functions can be defined anonymously. This is very idiomatic in clojure.
- Here we're mapping a function that could be called "times-five" over the range(10)
- Because it's so convenient to create anonymous functions on the fly this tends towards more readable names for named functions, since you don't exhaust the "good" names.

--

Anonymous Declaration
```clojure
(fn [x y] (+ x y))    ;; The longer shorthand
#(+ %1 %2)            ;; The very terse shorthand
```

--

Functions as Arguments and Return Values
```clojure
(map #(* 5 %) (range 10))
;; (0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45)
```

--
```clojure
(defn come-to-the-what-side [which]
  (fn [who]
    (str who ", come to the " which " side")))
```
--
```clojure
(def parenting (come-to-the-what-side "dark"))
```
--
```clojure
(parenting "Luke")
;;"Luke, come to the dark side"

```

---

Collections

Maps
```clojure
user=> (def sith {:master "Sidious" :apprentice "Tyranus"})
#'user/sith
user=> (:master sith)
"Sidious"
```
--
Lists and Vectors
```clojure
user=> (conj '(4 5 6) 1 2 3)
(3 2 1 4 5 6)  ;; Lists conj onto the left (slightly confusing) 
user=> (conj [4 5 6] 1 2 3)
[4 5 6 1 2 3]  ;; so Lucas uses vectors
user=> (into (conj [4 5 6] 1 2 3) [7 8 9])
[4 5 6 1 2 3 7 8 9]
```

--
Sets
```clojure
user=> (conj #{:sith :jedi} :jedi)
#{:jedi :sith}
```

???
- `def` is a var binding, not quite the same thing as variable declaration in other langs. While it is possible to directly overwrite these names in the REPL, that path leads to anger, hate, and suffering.
- `:master` and `:apprentice` are keyords. Keywords are, according to the official docs "symbolic identifiers that evaluate to themselves". They're basically useful barewords that also implement the iFn for getting the value for the keyword's own value from a map.
- Lists and vectors in Clojure are slightly different, most notably in their insertion order, but most consequentially in their performance characteristics, but otherwise they're mostly treated as sequences. This can occasionally lead to some confusion regarding return types, hence mapv and filterv and similar functions that return a specific type.
- However, lists and vectors and maps are all collections and so many functions are written with the intention of supporting them all.
- There are also sets, which behave similarly to sets in Python and other languages. Each element must be unique and there are set operations like union and intersection specifically for this type.

---

# Functional Basics in Clojure

Mapping functions over collections is a common pattern.
```clojure
(map some-function stuff-to-map-over)
```

???
- Mapping applies a function to every element within a collection and returns the result as a list.
- Filtering applies a predicate to every value in a collection and returns every value for which the predicate returns true.

--
Filtering is a similarly common pattern
```clojure
(filter some-predicate stuff-to-filter)
```
--
We can use this to make a Sith Detectorâ„¢.

```clojure
(defn is-sith [character]
  (clojure.string/includes? character "Darth"))

(def cast ["Darth Vader" "Yoda" "Darth Sidius" 
           "Ajit Pai" "Luke Skywalker" "Jar Jar Binks"])

(filter is-sith cast)
;; ("Darth Vader" "Darth Sidius")
```
---

# Functional Basics in Clojure

How about a function that turns Jedi into Sith?

```clojure
(defn bring-to-darkside [character]
  (str "Darth " character))

(map bring-to-darkside (filter (complement is-sith) cast))
```
That's starting to be a lot of nesting....

???
- Simple maps and filters (and reduces) is that they can be combined to make more powerful short but readable functions.
- Clojure has some macros that help us avoid drowning in parentheses.

--
We can do better with the threading macros `->` and `->>`

```clojure
(defn is-jedi [character]
  (-> character is-sith not))
  ;; Yoda actually speaks Clojure

(defn map-to-darkside [cast]
  (->> cast
      (filter is-jedi)
      (map bring-to-darkside)))

(map-to-darkside cast)
;; ("Darth Yoda" "Darth Ajit Pai" 
;;  "Darth Luke Skywalker" "Darth Jar Jar Binks")
```

---

# Functional Basics in Clojure

_Darth Jar Jar Binks_ has too many syllables, maybe let's just use last names.
--

```clojure
(defn last-name [character]
  (-> character 
    (clojure.string/split #" ") 
    last))

(defn map-to-darkside [cast]
  (->> cast
      (filter is-jedi)
      (map last-name)
      (map bring-to-darkside)))

(map-to-darkside cast)
;; ("Darth Yoda" "Darth Pai" "Darth Skywalker" "Darth Binks")
```
--
- Threading macros allow readable data pipelines that are easy to extend
- These macros avoid crazy nesting of parentheses
- You can achieve similar things using `(comp f g ...)`, however it can be more comfortable reading the transformations "forwards" with threading when there are many steps.

# Handling State

```clojure
user=> (def episodes [4 5 6])
#'user/episodes
user=> (into episodes [1 2 3])
[4 5 6 1 2 3]
user=> episodes
[4 5 6]
```

???
- As we can see the addition of episodes 1 2 and 3 mercifully have not persisted.
- This is because clojure data structures are immutable by default.
- To solve this we have several options for mutable state in clojure, but the most common one I've run across has been the atom.
- In terms of developer ergonomics atoms behave similarly to variables in other languages, except that they are thread safe.
--
Atoms

```clojure
user=> (def episodes (atom [4 5 6]))
#'user/episodes
user=> episodes
#object[clojure.lang.Atom 0x73a1dfc8 {:status :ready, :val [4 5 6]}]
user=> episodes
user=> (into episodes [1 2 3])

ClassCastException clojure.lang.Atom cannot be cast to 
clojure.lang.IPersistentCollection  clojure.core/conj--4345 (core.clj:82)
```
---
# Using Atoms

```clojure
user=> (def episodes (atom [4 5 6]))
#'user/episodes
user=> @episodes ;; equivalent to `(deref episodes)`
[4 5 6]
```
???
- We can dereference atoms (and other references like futures) using the `@` syntax or using the function `deref`.
- We can directly overwrite the value of the atom using `reset!`, the ! is convention to signal a function that will have side effects.
- This is not threadsafe however...
- Using `reset!` we ended up with all 3 crap episodes and only one good one. And they were out of order!
- This is because the threads that added episode 4 and 6 had their work overwritten by the other threads.
- We can use `swap!` which will ensure that threads won't overwrite a value that has changed since reading
- Update function must be referentially transparent

--
```clojure
user=> (reset! episodes [4 5 6 1 2 3])
user=> @episodes
[4 5 6 1 2 3]
```
--
```clojure
user=> (doseq [ep [4 5 6 1 2 3]]
  #_=>   (future (reset!           ;; Movies take a lot of work to make,
            episodes               ;; so we'll give each its own thread.
            (conj @episodes ep))))
user=> @episodes
[5 2 3 1]                          ;; We only got one good movie!?
```
--
```clojure
user=> (doseq [ep [4 5 6 1 2 3]]
  #_=>   (future (swap! episodes conj ep)))
nil
user=> @episodes
[4 6 5 2 3 1]
```
